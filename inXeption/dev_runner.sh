# ====================================================================
# STREAMLIT CONFIGURATION NOTE:
# ====================================================================
# Streamlit has two standard ways to look for configuration files:
# 1. ~/.streamlit/config.toml (standard location)
# 2. ${CWD}/.streamlit/config.toml (project-level location)
#
# IMPORTANT: Despite what some documentation might suggest, Streamlit does NOT
# reliably use XDG-spec folders (e.g., ~/.config/streamlit/config.toml).
# Testing has confirmed that Streamlit only looks in the standard locations.
#
# For consistent behavior across both development and production environments,
# we ensure the config file is in the standard location: ~/.streamlit/config.toml
#
# The configuration settings include:
# - Dark theme setting
# - Wide mode layout
# - Other Streamlit preferences
