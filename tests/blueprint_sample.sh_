# Regular shell comment

# ðŸ’™6.0 SHELL SCRIPT BLUEPRINT
# This is a blueprint in a shell script that documents
# architectural decisions related to shell scripts.
# The blueprint pattern works with consecutive comment lines.

echo "Hello World"

# Another regular comment
function sample_function() {
    # Function comment
    echo "This is a sample function"
}

# ðŸ’™6.1 SHELL SCRIPT IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
# Shell script blueprints must:
# 1. Start with a # comment
# 2. Have ðŸ’™ immediately after the # with no spaces between
# 3. All lines in the blueprint must be comments
# 4. No non-comment lines can appear within the blueprint

# This is not part of the blueprint above

# Indented comments also work
if [ true ]; then
    # ðŸ’™6.2 INDENTED BLUEPRINT
    # This blueprint is indented in the shell script
    # but the extraction process should handle it correctly
    echo "Indented code"
fi
